## 🎯 Key Design Decisions

### Core Focus Areas

1. **Exception Management First**
   - Start with alerts that matter
   - Eliminate false positives (especially "removed job" alerts)
   - Focus on actionable intelligence only

2. **Profitability Tracking**
   - Real-time margin analysis
   - Cost breakdown visibility
   - Pattern detection for unprofitable routes

3. **Efficiency Monitoring**
   - GPS-based proximity waste detection
   - Route grading system (A/B/C)
   - Clustering opportunities

---

## 🚀 Next Steps

### Immediate Actions (Today)
1. **Review Documentation**: Start with README.md for overview
2. **API Access**: Confirm FileMaker field access with database admin
3. **Environment Setup**: Install Node.js and configure .env.local

### Week 1 Sprint
1. **Monday**: FileMaker API integration
2. **Tuesday**: Polling mechanism
3. **Wednesday**: Alert engine
4. **Thursday**: Dashboard UI
5. **Friday**: Testing & refinement

### Critical Dependencies
- FileMaker API credentials (already provided)
- Additional field access approval (pending)
- Samsara API token (for GPS data)
- Google Maps API key (for geocoding)

## 💡 Key Innovations

### 1. Smart Change Detection
- Compare only same-day jobs
- Eliminate false "removal" alerts
- Focus on actual status changes

### 2. Actionable Alerts Only
- No historical reporting
- No information overload
- Only issues requiring intervention

### 3. Profitability Focus
- Per-job margin calculation
- Real-time cost analysis
- Revenue optimization suggestions

### 4. Efficiency Grading
- Visual A/B/C grades
- Proximity waste detection
- Route optimization hints
