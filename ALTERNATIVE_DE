# Alternative Deployment Options for EMD Polling Service

## Railway Free Tier Limitations ❌

Based on your research, Railway's free tier has critical restrictions:

- **Unverified GitHub accounts**: Only database deployment allowed, no code deployment
- **Verified accounts**: Limited trial period with usage restrictions
- **Full functionality**: Requires Hobby plan ($20/month) or Pro plan

**Result**: Railway deployment may not work for your account without upgrading.
